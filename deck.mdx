- christmas, kids, boardgames, cluedo, heuristic, want to code
- not giving my secret cluedo strategy away, let's write the interface
    python3 -c '
    import readline
    while True:
      line = input("guess: ")
      if line == "stop":
        break
      print("%s" % line)'
- now we can guess
  - Miss Scarlet, Professor Plum, Mrs Peacock, Reverend Green, Colonel Mustard,
    Mrs White
  - candlestick, dagger, lead pipe, revolver, rope, spanner
  - kitchen, ballroom, conservatory, dining room, cellar, billiard room,
    library, lounge, hall, study
  > It was Miss Scarlet with the dagger in the lounge
- and Agile! fail fast and fail early, no one want's this user interface!
- but hang on - KeyCastr ON
- esc-enter esc-enter
- 2w - jump 2 words
- c2w - change 2 words
- Reverend Green
- enter
- BOOM - wow
- KeyCastr OFF

# `VI` via readline

_more like it!_

```notes
- so what was there VI'ish in the code example?
- ^ beginning of line - just like a regex
- $ end of line - just like a regex
- c2w change 2 words
- u to undo
- these are VI shortcuts
```

---

# What is `VI`

  an editor

---

# Why `VI` is called VI?

  `ex` short for `EX`tended

  `ex` is a line editor

```notes
- what is a line editor
```

---

# `VI` = `VI`sual

  shortest unambigous abbreviation

---

# `VIM` = `V`i `IM`proved

---

# How to exit the Vim editor?

```sh
:q    # quit vi
:wq   # write file and quit
:q!   # quit vi not save
:x    # write and quit
```

---

# Demo - what is `VI`

```sh
vi            # open vi editor
i             # insert mode
              #   enter text
ESC           # normal mode
              #   special commands
h j k l       # ⬅ ⬇ ⬆ ➡
:             # ex mode - command mode
/             # search
n             # next match
:s///         # substitute
:q!           # quit without saving
```

---

# So far

* `Vi` where there is readline
* `Vi` in the editor
* what about everywhere?

```notes
- go back to program example and edit it
```

---

# `Vi` on the command line

```notes
- so now we have vi on the command line!
- what if I want to try?
```

---

# Demo - `vi` on command line

```sh
set -o vi
ESC             # normal mode
/               # search
cw              # change word
u  .            # undo and redo
^  $            # beginning and end
w  W            # word and whitespace word
b  B            # back a word
y               # yank (copy) to end
p               # paste
ct<char>        # cut to character
```

---

# get me out of here

```sh

set -o emacs    # get me out of here

```

---

# `Emacs`

```sh
set -o | egrep 'vi |emacs'

emacs          	on
vi             	off
```

emacs shortcuts
```sh
CTRL A        # beginning of line
CTRL E        # end of line
CTRL R        # reverse search
```

---

# But where is the `super power`?

```notes
- no alias
- story didn't touc type
- people setting up cursors to move faster
- heck do it with your current ide
- if you are in insert mode you are doing it wrong
- if you use a mouse you are doing it wrong
- have you tried this on a slow internet connection?
- can move around quickly
- can do edits to whole commands
- cursor speed ok
- no need for aliases
```

# Pauly principle

_if you repeat an action enough_

_it will become automatic_

_therefore effortless_

---

# Rote learning

1. come up with a drill
  ```
  set -o vi
  python -c 'print("hello")'
  <ESC> k $ b i
   Python
  <RETURN>
  set -o emacs
  ```
1. repeat

PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE

# `Vi` anywhere there is ReadLine

```notes
- python3 interactive console REPL

- even where there is no VI

# Questions?

```notes
- display keys typed [KeyCastr](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr)
```

---

# Where do you wish there was `VI` bindings?

- everywhere
- iPhone
- Browser
- IDE

```notes
- literally everywhere would be good
- have tried on iphone - not too cool -no esc key
- in browser but not everyone has it and fails in some edit boxes, not in dev toools
- in IDE but fails on git commit message editing
```

---

# What if there is no readline?

  * node
  * iex
  * mongodb

  ```sh

    brew install rlwrap

    rlwrap --always-readline node
    rlwrap --always-readline iex
    rlwrap --always-readline mongodb
  ```
